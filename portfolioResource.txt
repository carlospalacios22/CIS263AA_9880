Using Github to create a portfolio for future job searches is a great idea to show an employer the type of projects a person has worked on. While a resumes can be ideal  show job experience and desmostrate the type of enviroments a perosn has been in. Github can establish a preview of the skills the perosn may have. I belive that Github gives the opportunity in my job search where I can use it as portfolio to present projects I did in this course and others during an interview. Github is on the same level as linkedin when it comes to connections and searching for people but I have seen some employrs I've appllied to, ask for a Github page to review. So in that  sense it can be a complentary page or something to add on a resume like the link the Github profile.
