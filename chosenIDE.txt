There is a few IDEs  that I like to use for example IntelliJ and Android Studio. While Andriod studio is not the most suitable IDE to run Java code on, I really like the interface it provdes. the intial set up is a long process to use it as a  pure Java ID but it is free and a lot better than most paid Java IDEs. The oter is inteliJ which is great but I mainly  like to use it to run light console programs. While these two IDes were my go to for quite some time when I started learning to write in Java, I switched all together to Visual Studio Code becuase it provides the most features. What  I liked about Androiod studio and easy to use IntelliJ, can be found in Visual Studfio code. It provives the best of both worlds in one program and it can do essentially everything that I like to use it for. So for this course I will be using Visual Studio Code.
